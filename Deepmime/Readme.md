# Deepmime: A gesture Recognition System

## Introduction
Deepmime is a gesture recognition end to end system, which provides a User friendly Interface to the Gesture Recognition systemin the backend, to show, evaluate and update the results. 
The model used in this setup is based on the 3DResnet architecture, from https://github.com/saetlan/20BN-jester.


## Preparation
The model is trained on Jester Dataset with 27 labels. The trained model can be downloaded from [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7z3o6xuh78zasj6/AACuQct1BWp3SOIZyVk4C9-da?dl=0).  
Before running the model, make sure to add the model from above to the `Deepmime/API/Gesture-Recognition-with-3DRESNET/model`

## Note

This model is modified for Query-by-Gesture with Polypheny UI and is not running stand-alone.
