General introduction to architecture

Schema of architecture

was hard
problems with api
and setup with node
many many modules needed to setup no download and go

learn angular
understand angular

sockets
cors

then first facing the real problem

json file just took architecture of angular - difficult to reproduce in a clever way in python

algorithm to input nodes not quiet easy to implement, redo, undo storing since only non connected gestures - cant ersetzen a mouse

result:
have a running system that (sometimes) takes inputs and sends them to server - server constructs json
polypheny displays json

flaws:
no feedback - highlight
no keyboard input
no self made arrangement




we should have used fucking alexa
