\section{Conclusion}
\label{g1:sec:conclusion}
\subsection{Outcome}
Across board we are not satisfied with what we handed in. Since we had so much trouble with other things which kept us from improving or even deliver features. The outcome is borderline acceptable and far from good. It is no excuse but the overhead we had to deal in this project took away valuable time which we would have needed. Also connecting the two systems was not as easy as we thought.
\subsection{Lessons Learned}
\textbf{Angular}
\textbf{Ideas}
\textbf{Planning}
As discussed all over this report our planning was really off and problems we never faced had us big time. 
all - not what we wanted - connection between modules painful bc:
    CORS
    Sockets
    API
    Angular
lessons learned
- do not fucking use angular if you dont want to commit suicide - else it's a pretty good framework to lose believe in life and want to question your own existence
- Plan more in advance 
- do not lose time with stuff you cant fix
- do not believe assistants that it's an easy task nor believe that the project idea is thougt through 

like this the project has 0 relevance bc everything gets way harder even with voice control - column names are not like a normal person speaks
